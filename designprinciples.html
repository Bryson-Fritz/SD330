	<h1><u> Bryson's Principles </u></h1>
	</div>
	
	
	<div class="content" style="background-color: white; color: black;">
	<h2> Visibility </h2>
	<li> Design and format needs to be appealing and structured well </li>
	<li> Use appropriate UI for the system and your users </li>
	<li> Provide feedback for user </li>
	<li> Use smart color selection, like do not write navy blue words on a black background, that is hard for people to see who aren't even color blind </li>
	<li> Ensure font is big enough or just adjustable so it is suitable for the user </li>
	<li> Provide error messages if needed </li>
	<li> Use icons in your design but make sure they are obvious or globally familiar </li>
	<li> Avoid clutter, it is unorganized, may distract user, and it gets confusing </li>
	</div>


	<div class="content" style="background-color: black; color: white;">
	<h2> Consistency </h2>
	<li> Use similar functionality and symbols/icons as other applications so user doesn't get confused (things like home page in top left, dropdown menus, hamburger icon, search bar at top middle/right, etc.) </li>
	<li> Abstrain from implementing potentially confusing updates for users </li>
	<li> Maintain stability within your system </li>
	<li> Maintain a standard terminology within the system </li>
	</div>


	<div class="content" style="background-color: blue; color: orange;">
	<h2> Feedback </h2>
	<li> Provide users with quick feedback (within .1 seconds) </li>
	<li> Use visual, auditory feedback mechanisms to correspond to the users needs </li>
	<li> Apply to use of feedback but allow user to turn it off if they desire to </li>
	<li> Use feedback because it gives clear communication to the user </li>
	</div>


	<div class="content" style="background-color: orange; color: blue;">
	<h2> Constraints </h2>
	<li> Define constraints to limit the users ability within the system </li>
	<li> Prevent user from performing some action on system </li>
	<li> Use constraints in a system because we don't want user to do something or because they haven't done anything that would allow them to do some action </li>
	<li> Leverage constraints to enhance safety within a system, we do not want a user to do something they weren't/aren't supposed to do </li>
	</div>


	<div class="content" style="background-color: black; color: orange;">
	<h2> Affordances (Hint) </h2>
	<li> Ensure user knows what elements of system are interactive, can be clicked, tampered with </li>
	<li> Use visual clues to let user know about something that should be done </li>
	<li> Allow user to learn on their own, but help them out a bit </li>
	</div>


	<div class="content" style="background-color: purple; color: yellow;">
	<h2> Accessibility </h2>
	<li> Ensure system can be used by all users, that includes those with disabilities </li>
	<li> Provide alternative methods of interactions, some people may be able to do certain things, remember things, see things, etc. </li>
	<li> Comply with the needs for a variety of users </li>
	<li> Consider disabilities like color blindness, cognitive, physical, auditory, eyesight </li>
	</div>

	
	<div class="content" style="background-color: black; color: red;">
	<h2> Emotional </h2>
	<li> Consider emotions when it comes to the interaction with a system </li>
	<li> Address potential sources of pleasure vs frustration in the system </li>
	<li> Understand what emotions the user may be feeling </li>
	<li> Consider using feedback tools to gain data and "feedback" from user on how the system makes them feel </li>
	<li> Design elements that will please user, important for UI, UX, HCI </li>
	<li> Avoid clutter and inaccurate feedback for it may anger the user </li>
	</div>


	<div class="content" style="background-color: magenta; color: black;">
	<h2> Cognitive </h2>
	<li> Ackowledge the cognitive load you may be putting on your users, you don't want to give them too much information </li>
	<li> Aim to minimize mental effort within a system, have the user practically not think and just do </li>
	<li> Provide a straightforward experience, maybe use breadcrumbs, direct links, search bars </li>
	</div>


	<div class="content" style="background-color: black; color: green;">
	<h2> Complexity </h2>
	<li> Strive for simplicity in user interfaces </li>
	<li> Allow some complexity is a system </li>
	<li> Allow users to learn by doing </li>
	<li> Use functionality in your interfaces, maybe have some be different from other applications </li>
	</div>


	<div class="content" style="background-color: red; color: white;">
	<h2> Conceptional </h2>
	<li> Clarify models in a system, make it intuitive for users to understand </li>
	<li> Provide clear guidance to user throughout their experience </li>
	<li> Utilize metaphors, isomorphic, skeuomorphic (depending on users), in your design </li>
	</div>


	<div class="content" style="background-color: maroon; color: white;">
	<h2> Gender/Cultural </h2>
	<li> Consider cultural and gender related factors when you're making your design </li>
	<li> Ensure the system is not offensive to any genders or culturals </li>
	<li> Avoid stereotypes in your design </li>
	<li> Acknowledge that symbols/signs mean different things amongst different cultures and countries </li>
	</div>


	<div class="content" style="background-color: black; color: cyan;">
	<h2> Errors </h2>
	<li> Provide informative error messages </li>
	<li> Prevent data loss when errors occur </li>
	<li> Implement guides for different error messages </li>
	<li> Display errors in a different color than the rest of the page, usually red is appropriate </li>
	</div>

	<div class="clear"></div>
